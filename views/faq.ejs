			                         <p>The solution is, in a way, quite simple. We need to reduce all human made greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to zero. Ultimately this will be achieved by:</p>
			                       <ul>
									    <li>Fully Decarbonising Electricity Generation (making it zero carbon e.g. from renewable energy sources)</li>
									    <li>Fully Decarbonising Transport (cars, trucks, aircraft, ships etc.)</li>
									    <li>Stopping Deforestation (this currently contributes around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions)</li>
									    <li>Planting lots more trees (trees sequester the carbon already in the atmosphere and store it away)</li>
									    <li>Reduce emissions from farming / agriculture and significantly reducing the consumption of meat (especially red meat)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Whilst positive progress is being made in many of these key areas, there is still much more to be done. Until we reach these goals we also need to reduce energy consumption across the board to slow down the rate of climate change.</p>

			                      <p>This has some truth to it and we should all try and reduce emissions as much as possible. However, it is not currently possible to reduce emissions to zero on a global level. There currently isn't enough renewable (or zero carbon) electricity to meet the global energy demand. There isn't currently anywhere near enough zero carbon forms of transport that can be practically used to meet the needs of international trade. No matter what you do to reduce your energy consumption and carbon footprint you are almost certainly going to still be responsible for some carbon emissions - not just from your direct energy usage, but indirectly from things you buy and services you use.</p>
			                      <p>By supporting carbon offsetting projects, you are supporting the solutions to climate change, through choosing to help fund more renewable energy production; help fund improved efficiencies in developing countries; help fund teams working to reduce deforestation (which currently contributes around 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions); and helping plant more trees to capture and store carbon that has already been emitted into the atmosphere.</p>

			                      <p>Carbon emissions do not respect international borders; as the CO2 enters the atmosphere, it spreads out and has an impact on the global climate. This means that 1 tonne of CO2 emissions emitted in Mumbai is the same as 1 tonne of CO2 being emitted in Manchester. This is the reason why we can compensate carbon emissions by supporting projects in other nations.</p>
			                      <p>The solution to climate change cannot be provided by one country going zero carbon - we need global energy supply and global transportation to also be zero carbon, as well as helping protect established forests (the carbon stores) from deforestation. Supporting and encouraging more and more projects like these around the world through finance initiatives is a significant part of the solution to climate change. Whilst governments (around the world) delay in providing the funding and support needed for these project, you have the chance to step up and help out by offsetting your emissions. </p>

			                      <p>In a Utopian world, every organisation would be able to reduce its carbon emissions to zero – and perhaps even be net positive (e.g. with sufficient access to on-site renewable power and export to the National Grid). In practice, this is far more difficult, not only down to capital investment needs, but also cultural barriers and supply chain decisions (particularly relating to transport/travel).</p>
			                      <p>There are several further benefits for offsetting with projects outside your own organisation. Frequently these projects are more cost effective than reducing CO2 on-site (this can cost in excess of 10 x more depending on where your organisation is located). Also, frequently the projects are located in developing countries where additional benefits include local employment, health and education.</p>
			                      <p>The vast majority of organisations claiming carbon neutrality are achieving this with at least some carbon offsetting. Global brands that offset include Microsoft, DHL, Marks & Spencer, Sky etc., whilst having programmes to reduce emissions they also support global carbon offsetting initiatives - recognising the importance of the global solution.</p>
